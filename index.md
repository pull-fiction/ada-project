## War is served

When it comes to wars, literature gives us a clear idea about they affect a country’s economy, social structure and politics. But far from being that detached from everyday experience, wars pervade citizen's life deeply, affecting all their daily activities, till the most basic need: eating. However, impact on food and crop production has not been studied extensively, especially for recent events. Our intention is to fill in this gap – for the good of our society.

## How war tastes around the world

This delicate topic doesn't allow for any generalization. Every country has its own unique story, every war its factors, each crop its productive cycle.

However, with the help of data we are still able to grasp, for each country, a general trend in agricultural production over the last 60 years. 
(SHOW GRAPH WITH DROP DOWN)

Clearly, different countries exhibit wildly different behaviors while there are conflicts within their territory. In order to get a global view of the effects of war on a countries crop production, let’s take a look at a normalized yearly rate of change in crop production for each country on one plot. The average rates of change of crop production of countries during years of peace can be seen on the Y-axis while the X-axis displays the rates in times of conflict. (SHOW SCATTER PLOT)

As expected, during peace, the majority of countries experience positive crop production growth. However, the obtained result during times of war is quite unexpected, isn't it? Although one would be led to believe that a country’s crop production would generally decrease in periods of conflict within its boundaries, this is not always the case. The rates during periods of conflict are substantially polarized (between -4% and +4%). Surprisingly, some countries experience more crop production growth during conflicts than during peace.

Global conflicts are extremely complex and are impacted by thousands of unique factors.
Effectively comparing different conflicts is nearly impossible. For the scope of this project, we have decided to dig deeper into one specific country and one specific conflict in order to gain an understanding of how one particular conflict has impacted this country.

## A case study: Lebanon

For our analysis, we have decided to investigate the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990). The main reason why we chose this case study is because of its unexpected cases where crop production dramatically increased during the conflict. Let’s take a closer look at Lebanon’s crop production. We have selected this particular conflict as it is of considerable length, falls approximately in the middle of our data time-frame and is one of the unexpected cases where crop production dramatically increased during the conflict. Let’s take a closer look at Lebanon’s crop production. (SHOW GRAPH OF LEBANON CROP)

Why would production of crops increase as steeply as it does during a major internal conflict? Wouldn’t it make more sense for the production to go down as people flee the country, or at a minimum stay constant? Clearly, migrating to Lebanon must not have been a popular plan at the time and hence, if anything the population was more likely to decline rather than increase during that time. A quick glance at import data shows that the country’s imports did not decrease, which could have created a need for more production. (SHOW GRAPH HERE? OR SIMPLY MENTION SOURCE?) It is possible that this is simply a coincidence, but the fact that the increase suddenly stops directly after the war suggests otherwise. To answer our questions, we must first get a better understanding of Lebanon’s agricultural situation.

The majority of Lebanon’s agriculture is located away from it’s main urban area, Beirut. In fact, almost no agriculture takes place anywhere near Beirut, which happens to be the most densely populated city of Lebanon, having approximately 50% of Lebanon’s population (COMPLETE GUESS, GET DATA).
